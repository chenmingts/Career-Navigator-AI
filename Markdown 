# Career Navigator AI

## Overview

Career Navigator AI is a **domain-specific RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application** built to assist job seekers and recruiters in finding the best matches between resumes and job descriptions.  
By leveraging **semantic search with embeddings**, a **vector database (Pinecone)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, Career Navigator AI creates a smart and interactive platform for career exploration.

This project is submitted as part of the INFO 7390 Spring 2025 Final Project, following **Option 1: AI-Powered RAG Application**.

## Project Goals

- ðŸ§  Create a **semantic search engine** for matching resumes and job descriptions.
- ðŸ“š Use **domain-specific datasets** of resumes and job descriptions.
- ðŸš€ Integrate **Pinecone** as a **vector database** for efficient retrieval.
- ðŸ¤– Leverage **sentence-transformer models** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to create high-quality text embeddings.
- ðŸŒŸ Build an interactive **Streamlit** UI for users to input queries and view relevant matches.
